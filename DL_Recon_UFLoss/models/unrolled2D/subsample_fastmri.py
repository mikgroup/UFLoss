    """
    MaskFunc creates a sub-sampling mask of a given shape.
    The mask selects a subset of columns from the input k-space data. If the k-space data has N
    columns, the mask picks out:
        1. N_low_freqs = (N * center_fraction) columns in the center corresponding to
           low-frequencies
        2. The other columns are selected uniformly at random with a probability equal to:
           prob = (N / acceleration - N_low_freqs) / (N - N_low_freqs).
    This ensures that the expected number of columns selected is equal to (N / acceleration)
    It is possible to use multiple center_fractions and accelerations, in which case one possible
    (center_fraction, acceleration) is chosen uniformly at random each time the MaskFunc object is
    called.
    For example, if accelerations = [4, 8] and center_fractions = [0.08, 0.04], then there
    is a 50% probability that 4-fold acceleration with 8% center fraction is selected and a 50%
    probability that 8-fold acceleration with 4% center fraction is selected.
